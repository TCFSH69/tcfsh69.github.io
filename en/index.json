At most 24 units from undergrad and needs approval from INI. Per semester, choose at least 1 core course, unless you have done all of them. Introductory courses cannot be taken after the advanced ones. You can drop courses in 6 weeks from the beginning of the semester. You have one chance to use drop voucher every year, which prevents a withdrawal letter \u0026lsquo;W\u0026rsquo; shown on the transcript. Waitlist is common. You will definitely get into the INI courses, and you probably have a strong chance with the SCS ones as well.
